included file for lands

i am adding ajax to this page.

all alnd types will have a map coordinate associated with them
they will all display themselves on the map
[right]
or maybe make a way for them to associate lands with where theya re on the map?
[no] 


show the map here with markings. markings will be an object with id-of-land:[coordiantes to put on map]


i will draw the map with that object and fetch the homes through a custom query. all those will be invisible, and appear on hover
OR i could lazy load them on hover. what do you think is best?

when i choose a house i use the slug.... slugs should be short. but will they be? maybe best to use the post id?
what do you think?????
[short enough]

then do homes in the same way.

also i dont like the transitions on the site on the quote page. i will keep the previously picked house type and land on the 
left when you begin picking the facade. what do you think?
[yup]

on the single home page contact form, insert the the page subject that they were looking at - whihc floor plan? which page url?
append it to the message thet people write

make the last part of the quote look better

also i want to change the last part of quote - now it looks too ugly.
 
so based on what part of quote we are on we load a speciffic file
also, get rid of gloabl quote taglines - put the land plot name in there, fullscreen it. 
put stuff/text over it.
[do that]


No, bad way to do it - navigation will get screwed up.
i will need to load the new quote page stuff.... but then what if the person refreshes. then i lose 
everything. need to keep it in the url - say if url has a hashtag and its equal to "land,home,facade" it meanst im on the
quote page. reload content of that page with the starting quote-rocess page 


???SHOUDL I ADD/TRY TO MAKE the same sliding menu as that instagram site?
