Code base for a property/land management agency [still in development].
Here I either modified existing plugin files to embed it into the theme or wrote them myself.
All the PHP files I wrote can be found at:
```
/templates
/ajax
/functions.php
/<anything else in the root folder, but it's trivial - they're mostly includes>
``` 

JS files written by me are at:
```
/js/scripts.js
```

Styles written by me at:
```
/css/styles.css
/css/media.css
```

Some interesting pages:
